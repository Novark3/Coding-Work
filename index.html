        <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial; text-indent: 50px">Welcome to the website! This website is being made for a class that I am currently attending. This class is about coding. It is part of the Expeditions program of a school called Summit Shasta. We do Expeditions every few months and we split them up into 1-3 week sections.</p>

        <header>Overview</header>
        <p>We are learning about the <em>basics</em> of HTML, CSS, and web design for now, so that hopefully one day we can code freely and without struggle. We are also learning to code so that someday we can design websites, animations, and video-games. So far we have gone over CSS and HTML. We now know how to code websites that, <em>for the most part</em>, run smoothly and how we want.</p>
        <img src="" <header>Purpose</header>
        <p>The main purpose of this webpage is to teach people who may not be experienced in coding, a first look at the subject. This website will be going over HTML, CSS, and all of the major components within them. We are going to be learning about things like tags and attributes of various uses. Hopefully, by the time you are done with this website you can go and code your own website!</p>

            I am Ryan Rusali. I was born in the year 2000 and am currently 13 years old. I am attending Summit Shasta High School in Daly City. I have done things in my life that others may not have. I am the leader of a debate club at school and have two different eye colors. A few things about me is that some of my favorite movies are:

These are things like Boy Scouts, playing video games, reading books, hanging out with friends, and spending time with my family. I Scouting we do things like hiking, swimming, camping, and just all around having a good time. I also like to listen to music while working. When something seems like it could get boring or be tedious, I listen to music and the work becomes bearable.</div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 50px">Coding Basics</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size: 35">HTML</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial; text-indent: 50px">HTML is a <em>very </em>important coding device that helps design wepages and amounts of text. HTML was developed by CERN and it allowed for easy webpage designing and editing. HTML allows people like me or you who might not have much experience with coding, to jump into it and make very detailed and nicely arranged websites. HTML allows us to insert pictures, organize ideas, and present things in a visually pleasing way. With the correct code, ideas become clear and information becomes easier to understand.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 35px">CSS</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 30px; text-indent: 50px">
            CSS is another type of coding that allows users to make large-scale attribute changes with only a few lines of code. This saves a developer lots of time and energy. Not having to go through adding hundreds of attributes, but instead having them on a single line, helps coders tremendously. CSS also allows for further in-depth changes such as borders, buttons, and text alignment without a scramble of messy code.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size 35px">Tags</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 30px; text-indent: 50px">Tags are HTML's way of determining how to interpret a message. The tag tells the software whether it is a paragraph or an image. Tags help the software interpret the listed information correctly and efficiently. They categorize information into ver seperate and distinct bins so that the program does not waste time sorting through all of the different pieces of text and color individually. This way, the entire process off coding and rendering is sped up tremendously. Some very important tags are the:
        </p>
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">
            <p1>Click For More CSS</p1>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>Paragraph tag</li>
            <li>Heading tag</li>
            <li>Doctype tag</li>
            <li>Image tag</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 30px; text-indent: 50px">The paragraph tag looks like <strong> < p > </strong>. This tag allows for paragraphs to be sectioned off and organized in a very clear way. Paragraphs allow for the separation of ideas and information.
            <div style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial">The heading tag looks like <strong>< h1 ></strong> and can have a number anywhere from 1-6. These numbers give priorities if there are <em>many</em> different titles in close proximity to one another. This prevents glitches and messy graphical overlays.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The doctype tag tells the software what kind of document the listed document is. In this paper, the doctype is html. The tag is listed in the code as <strong>< !DOCTYPE html ></strong>. This allows for proper reading and displaying of the document. Any document that is written in HTML has this tag at the very beginning of the coded section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last tag that I will be talking about is the image tag. This tag allows the user to place images on the page for the reader to see. The tag is listed as <strong>< img ></strong> in the code. The way that someone would use this tag would be by writing out the tag, and then adding the src attribute to it. After adding the url to the quoted section, the image is displayed for all to see.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 35px">Attributes</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial; text-indent: 50px">
            Attributes provide the software a further level of interpretation and give the coder another level of personalization and customization, like a modifier. Attributes allow the coder to change the font a paragraph is shown as, the color of the text, it allows for indents, and you can also change the size of the font and much more. All of these different tools allow for amazing websites with stunning visuals. Each tag has its own set of attributes, some more than otehrs, there are no limits of how many attributes are allowed per tag. This allows for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of different possibilities for one paragraph. Some possible attributes are:
